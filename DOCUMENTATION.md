Server generated events:

|Event ID|Description|
|---    |---    |
|watchlist.hit.process|This event happens when a watchlist matches a new process upon ingest. Note that the process may not be visible in the Carbon Black UI or searches until it’s been committed to disk (may take ~15 minutes)|
|watchlist.storage.hit.process|Same as watchlist.hit.process, but now the data has been committed to disk by Cb and the data is available via the Cb UI or API|

|ingress.event.tamper|A process tampered with a critical Carbon Black userspace process or kernel driver|

Below is an example of a watchlist.hit.process event.  The following table breaks up the key value pairs and gives a description.

Note that the LEEF output generated by the Carbon Black event forwarder is encoded in UTF-8. Tabs and newlines included as part of a field value are escaped as “\t” and “\n” respectively. Single backslashes in any field’s value are transmitted as “\\”. Note that the sample output you have may not include this escape mechanism; we have added this in the latest code base to avoid parsing ambiguity when newlines and tabs are encountered in the input data.  I have adjusted the example data below to reflect the backslash
